### Web Application

The web application is designed to run as a development server or be deployed as a web service, not as a standalone binary.

**For Development:**
```bash
# Start the React development server
cd web && npm run dev

# Build for production
cd web && npm run build
```

### Web API

The web server provides a comprehensive REST API with full CRUD operations:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Version information
curl http://localhost:8080/version

# Trips API (Full CRUD)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/trips                                    # GET all trips
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/trips -d '{"date":"2024-01-01","origin":"Home","destination":"Work","miles":10,"type":"single"}' # CREATE
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/trips/0 -d '{"date":"2024-01-02","origin":"Home","destination":"Work","miles":12,"type":"single"}' # UPDATE
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/trips/0                        # DELETE

# Expenses API (Full CRUD)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/expenses                                  # GET all expenses
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/expenses -d '{"date":"2024-01-01","amount":25.50,"description":"Gas"}' # CREATE
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/expenses/0 -d '{"date":"2024-01-02","amount":30.00,"description":"Parking"}' # UPDATE
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/expenses/0                     # DELETE

# Weekly summaries (read-only)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/summaries                                # GET summaries
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/trips` - List all trips
- `POST /api/trips` - Create a new trip
- `PUT /api/trips/{index}` - Update trip at index
- `DELETE /api/trips/{index}` - Delete trip at index
- `GET /api/expenses` - List all expenses
- `POST /api/expenses` - Create a new expense
- `PUT /api/expenses/{index}` - Update expense at index
- `DELETE /api/expenses/{index}` - Delete expense at index
- `GET /api/summaries` - Get weekly summaries (read-only)

## Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/laurendc/nannytracker.git
cd nannytracker

# Install development dependencies
make deps

# Run tests
make test

# Build for development (fast, current platform)
make build

# Quick development build with verification
./scripts/dev-build.sh

# Build for all platforms (releases only)
make build-all

# Run linter
make lint

# Format code
make fmt
```

### Build Workflow

NannyTracker uses an optimized build workflow to balance development speed with cross-platform support:

```bash
# Development builds (fast, current platform)
make build              # Standard development build
./scripts/dev-build.sh  # Quick build with verification

# Release builds (all platforms)
make build-all          # Full cross-platform build for releases
```

**Build Strategy:**
- **Development**: Fast Linux builds for daily work
- **CI/CD**: Linux-only builds for PR checks (faster)
- **Releases**: Full cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Go tests
make test

# Run tests with race detection
make test-race

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run web frontend tests
cd web && npm test
```

### Release Management

NannyTracker uses a comprehensive release management system with automated builds and versioning.

#### Creating a Release

```bash
# Create a new release (requires VERSION=)
make release VERSION=v1.0.0
```

This will:
1. Run all tests
2. Build binaries for all platforms
3. Create a git tag
4. Trigger GitHub Actions to create a release

#### Version Information

```bash
# Check version from command line
./nannytracker --version

# Check version via API
curl http://localhost:8080/version
```
